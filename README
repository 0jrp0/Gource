1. Description
==============

OpenGL-based 3D visualisation tool for source control repositories.

The repository is displayed as a tree where the root of the repository is the
centre, directories are branches and files are leaves. Contributors to the
source code appear and disappear as they contribute to specific files and
directories.

2. Requirements
===============

Gource's display is rendered using OpenGL and requires a 3D accelerated video
card to run.

3. Using Gource

    --path PATH

    path    Either a supported version control directory, a pre-generated log
            file (see log commands or the custom log format), a gource conf
            file or '-' to read STDIN.

            If path is ommited, gource will attempt to read a log from the
            current directory.

Git, Bazaar and Mercurial Examples:

View the log of the respository in the current path:

    gource

View the log of a project in the specified directory:

    gource my-project-dir

Save a copy of the log using in a special log format and play it back
(example is for Git):

    cd my-git-project
    `gource --git-log-command` > my-git-project.log
    gource my-git-project.log

NOTE: --git-log-command assumes you have a recent version git of that supports
      all the options. You may need to modify the command line to work with an
      older version (changing %aN to %an for instance).

Other Version Control Systems:

Visit the Gource homepage for guides and examples of using Gource with other
version control systems:

    CVS       - http://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/CVS
    SVN       - http://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/SVN

Custom Log Format:

If you want to use Gource with something other than the supported systems,
there is a pipe ('|') delimited custom log format:

    timestamp - A unix timestamp of when the update occured.
    username  - The name of the user who made the update.
    type      - initial for the update type - (A)dded, (M)odified or (D)eleted.
    file      - Path of the file updated.
    colour    - A colour for the file in hex (FFFFFF) format. Optional.

Recording Videos:

See the guide on the homepage for examples of recording videos with Gource:

    http://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/Videos

Interface:

The time shown in the top left of the screen is set initially from the first
log entry read and is incremented according to the simulation speed 
(--seconds-per-day).

Pressing SPACE at any time will pause/unpause the simulation. While paused you
may use the mouse to inspect the detail of individual files and users.

TAB cycles through selecting the current visible users.

The camera mode, either tracking activity or showing the entire code tree, can
be toggled using the Middle mouse button.

You can drag the left mouse button to manually control the camera. The right
mouse button rotates the view.

Interactive keyboard commands:

    (V)   Toggle camera mode
    (C)   Displays Gource logo
    (M)   Toggle mouse visibility
    (N)   Jump forward in time to next log entry.
    (+-)  Adjust simulation speed.
    (<>)  Adjust time scale.
    (TAB) Cycle through visible users
    (ESC) Quit
