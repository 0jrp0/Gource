1. Description
===============

OpenGL-based 3D visualisation tool for source control repositories.

The repository is displayed as a tree where the root of the repository is the centre, directories are branches
and files are leaves. Contributors to the source code appear and disappear as they contribute to specific files
and directories.

2. Requirements
===============

Gource's display is rendered using OpenGL and requires a 3D accelerated video card to run.

3. Installation
===============

You can either build Gource from scratch or install a pre-compiled binary version from the homepage (recommended).

4. Using Gource
===============

gource <options> <path>

    path    Either a Git or Mercurial directory, a pre-generated log file (see --git-log-command, --hg-log-command or the custom
            log format) or '-' to read STDIN. If path is ommited gource will attempt to read a log from the current directory.

Git and Mercurial Examples:

View the log of the respository in the current path:

    gource

View the log of a project in the specified directory:

    gource my-project-dir

Save a copy of the log using in a special log format and play it back (example is for Git, Mercurial users see --hg-log-command):

    cd my-git-project
    `gource --git-log-command` > my-git-project.log
    gource my-git-project.log

NOTE: --git-log-command assumes you have a recent version git of that supports all the options. You may need to modify
the command line to work with an older version (changing %aN to %an for instance).

Other Version Control Systems:

Visit the Gource homepage for guides and examples of using Gource with other version control systems:

    CVS       - http://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/CVS
    SVN       - http://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/SVN

Custom Log Format:

If you want to use Gource with something other than the supported systems, there is a pipe ('|') delimited custom log format:

    timestamp - A unix timestamp of when the update occured.
    username  - The name of the user who made the update.
    type      - Single character for the update type - (A)dded, (M)odified or (D)eleted.
    file      - Path of the file updated.
    colour    - A colour for the file in hex (FFFFFF) format. Optional.

Recording Videos:

You can create a video of Gource using the --output-ppm-stream option. This creates an uncompressed sequence of
screenshots in PPM format which can then be processed by another program (such as ffmpeg) to produce a video file.

The below command line will create a video at 60fps in x264 format (assumes you have ffmpeg with x264 support):

    gource --output-ppm-stream - | ffmpeg -y -b 3000K -r 60 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - -vcodec libx264 gource.mp4

Interface:

The time shown in the top left of the screen is set initially from the first log entry read and is incremented
according to the simulation speed (--seconds-per-day).

Pressing SPACE at any time will pause/unpause the simulation. While paused you may use the mouse to inspect the
detail of individual files and users.

TAB cycles through selecting the current visible users.

The camera mode, either tracking activity, or showing the entire code tree, can be toggled using the V key.

Interactive keyboard commands:

    (V)   Toggle camera mode
    (C)   Displays Gource logo
    (N)   Jump forward in time to next log entry.
    (+-)  Adjust simulation speed.
    (<>)  Adjust time scale.
    (TAB) Cycle through visible users
    (ESC) Quit

5. Building Gource
==================

The source code to Gource is available from the homepage.

Gource requires the following libraries to compile:

    SDL 1.2 (libsdl1.2-dev)
    SDL Image 1.2 (libsdl-image1.2-dev)
    PCRE3 (libpcre3-dev)
    FTGL 2.1.3~rc5-2 (libftgl-dev)
    PNG library (libpng12-dev)
    JPEG library (libjpeg62-dev)

Building on Linux:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If you are unfamilar with configure see the INSTALL file.

Building on Windows:

On Windows I recommend compiling the project gource.win32.cbp
with the Code Blocks IDE (www.codeblocks.org).
