.SH NAME
Gource - a software version control visualization
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIgource\fR
<options> <path>
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIgource\fR is an OpenGL-based 3D visualisation tool for source control repositories.

The repository is displayed as a tree where the root of the repository is the centre, directories are branches and files are leaves. Contributors to the source code appear and disappear as they contribute to specific files and directories.

.SH GIT, BAZAAR AND MERCURIAL EXAMPLES

View the log of the respository in the current path:

.ti 10
\fIgource\fR

View the log of a project in the specified directory:

.ti 10
\fIgource\fR my\-project\-dir

Save a copy of the log using in a special log format and play it back (example is for Git):

.ti 10
cd my\-git\-project
.ti 10
\`\fIgource\fR \-\-git\-log\-command\` > my\-git\-project.log
.ti 10
\fIgource\fR my\-git\-project.log

NOTE: \-\-git-log-command assumes you have a recent version of git that supports all the options. You may need to modify the command line to work with an older version (changing %aN to %an for instance).

.SH OTHER VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS

The Gource homepage has guides and examples for using Gource with other version control systems:

.ti 10
CVS       - http://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/CVS
.ti 10
SVN       - http://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/SVN

.SH CUSTOM LOG FORMAT

If you want to use Gource with something other than the supported systems, there is a pipe ('|') delimited custom log format:

.ti 10
timestamp - A unix timestamp of when the update occured.
.ti 10
username  - The name of the user who made the update.
.ti 10
type      - Single character for the update type - (A)dded, (M)odified or (D)eleted.
.ti 10
file      - Path of the file updated.
.ti 10
colour    - A colour for the file in hex (FFFFFF) format. Optional.

.SH RECORDING VIDEOS

See the guide on the homepage for examples of recording videos with Gource:

.ti 10
http://code.google.com/p/gource/wiki/Videos

.SH INTERFACE
The time shown in the top left of the screen is set initially from the first log entry read and is incremented according to the simulation speed (\-\-seconds\-per\-day).

Pressing SPACE at any time will pause/unpause the simulation. While paused you may use the mouse to inspect the detail of individual files and users.

TAB cycles through selecting the current visible users.

The camera mode, either tracking activity, or showing the entire code tree, can be toggled using the V key. You can drag the mouse on the background to manually control the camera.

Interactive keyboard commands:
.sp
.ti 10
(V)   Toggle camera mode
.ti 10
(C)   Displays Gource logo
.ti 10
(M)   Toggle mouse visibility.
.ti 10
(N)   Jump forward in time to next log entry.
.ti 10
(+-)  Adjust simulation speed.
.ti 10
(<>)  Adjust time scale.
.ti 10
(TAB) Cycle through visible users
.ti 10
(ESC) Quit
